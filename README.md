# Thanaweya-Amma-Educational-Performance-Analysis

## 📌 Overview
This repository contains a comprehensive study analyzing the socio-economic determinants of educational performance in Egypt's *Thanaweya Amma* exams (2022-2023). The project explores correlations between governorate-level GDP, economic sectors, and student outcomes using statistical methods and visualizations.

## 🔍 Key Findings
- **Positive Correlation**: Petroleum sector GDP dependency linked to higher exam scores (r=0.47).  
- **Negative Correlation**: Construction sector dependency associated with lower scores (r=-0.52).  
- **Consistency**: Strong year-to-year correlation in governorate performance (r=0.94).  
- **GDP Insights**: Cairo had the highest GDP (1.87T EGP), while South Sinai led in GDP per capita (501K EGP/person).

## 📊 Methodology
1. **Data Sources**: Public datasets on exam results, governorate GDP, and sectoral contributions.  
2. **Preprocessing**: Standardized governorate names, merged datasets, and calculated z-scores.  
3. **Analysis**:  
   - Descriptive statistics (mean, SD) for grades and GDP.  
   - Correlation matrices and hypothesis testing (α=0.05).  
   - Heatmaps and distribution plots (Figures 1–11 in report).  

## 🛠 Tools Used
- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib) for data analysis.  
- Statistical testing (z-scores, correlation coefficients).  

## 📝 Conclusion
Socio-economic factors significantly impact *Thanaweya Amma* outcomes, with petroleum-rich regions outperforming others. Findings advocate for equitable resource allocation to bridge educational gaps.
